# Your domain's DNS (Route 53 hosted zone) and the TLS certificate for the API.
#
# These live in bootstrap, not infra, because they must survive `terraform destroy` of infra:
#   - a recreated hosted zone gets NEW nameservers, so you'd have to update your registrar again
#     (and wait for DNS to catch up) after every teardown;
#   - certificate validation also waits on that DNS.
# Cost: USD 0.50/month for the zone; ACM certificates are free.
#
# One-time setup after the first apply (the domain was bought outside this AWS account):
#   terraform output name_servers  ->  set these 4 as your domain's nameservers at your registrar.
# From then on Route 53 answers for the domain, ACM sees its validation record, and the certificate
# turns ISSUED by itself (usually minutes, up to a few hours while DNS changes spread).
